## AOL ad killer


</div>

### Description

This code will close and (To the extent of my knowlege) stop AOL ads from downloading. These are not the popup window ads, but the ads on the read email, buddy list, etc. This code was tested in Compuserve, but should work the same with AOL. Let me know if it doesn't. Just run it and watch!
